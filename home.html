          <h1>Symptoms of Coronavirus</h1>

          <p>
            Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no
            symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because
            they are similar to a cold or flu.
          </p>

          <p>
            Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to
            COVID-19. This is the longest known infectious period for this
            disease. We are currently investigating if the virus can be
            transmitted to others if someone is not showing symptoms. While
            experts believe that it is possible, it is considered less common.
          </p>

          <p>Symptoms have included:</p>

                    <p>
                      The risk depends on where you are - and more
                      specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak
                      unfolding there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For most people in most locations the risk of catching
                      COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places
                      around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is
                      spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these
                      areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher.
                      Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous
                      action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified.
                      Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel,
                      movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease
                      control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or
                      spreading COVID-19.

                      COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission
                      stopped, as has been shown in China and some other
                      countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge
                      rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation
                      where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily
                      updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

                      Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild,
                      especially for children and young adults. However, it
                      can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who
                      catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite
                      normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19
                      outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.

                      We can channel our concerns into actions to protect
                      ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and
                      foremost among these actions is regular and thorough
                      hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly,
                      keep informed and follow the advice of the local health
                      authorities including any restrictions put in place on
                      travel, movement and gatherings.

                      Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms
                      (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may

                      ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide

                      cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and

                        After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops
